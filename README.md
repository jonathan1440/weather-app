I used the following tutorial to start me off on creating a scatterplot.

This unfinisehd repoistory is how I'm getting the weather data: https://github.com/jonathan1440/Get-Weather-Data

To-do:
1. Create graph prefab
   - box/mesh outline
   - toggle walk around/rotate graph
   - scale graph
   - drag/reposition graph
   - duplicate graph
   - make graph selectable
2. Work on scatterplot
   - change ball radius
   - change color/color scheme
3. Make graph type level
   - show axes
   - change axes
4. Create new graph
   - from ui-imported CSV file
