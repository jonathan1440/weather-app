# weather-app

The goal is to create a Unity web app showing weather data from my house for my senior project.

I used the following tutorial to start me off on creating a scatterplot.

To-do:
1. Create graph prefab
   - box/mesh outline
   - toggle walk around/rotate graph
   - scale graph
   - drag/reposition graph
   - duplicate graph
   - make graph selectable
2. Work on scatterplot
   - change ball radius
   - change color/color scheme
3. Make graph type level
   - show axes
   - change axes
4. Create new graph
   - from ui-imported CSV file
